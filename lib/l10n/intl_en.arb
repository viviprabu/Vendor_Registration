It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktoppublishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply randomtext. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor atHampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites.\\nThestandard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Ciceroare also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.",
